# Versatile-Analysis-of-Body-Temperature

## General Goals

The main goal of the project is to produce a system which can process the data obtained from temperature sensors placed in a variety of animals. These data logging sensors are left in the body for relatively long periods of time (from a few days to a few years) and record the temperature of the animal every few minutes. The data produced generally follows a sinusoidal trend with a period of roughly one day. The team aims to produce software which can fit a curve to this sinusoid and produce a report using this cosinor analysis. This allows the research team to understand more about the connection of body temperature fluctuations with the health and wellbeing of an animal. The research seems to suggest that body temperature fluctuations can reliably indicate how well the animal will grow and how fit and strong it is likely to be. Beyond that the software must also provide a way to show when outliers are present as this is a strong indicator of the animal being ill, mistreated or under a range other stressors. This is so significant as many of the current methods for measuring stress levels are not as reliable as this.

## Current System

The current system employed by the research group involves manually importing the data, from the CSV files produced by the data loggers, into Excel. From there the researchers use a macro to run a periodogram analysis on the data which allows for a further cosinor analysis. This system is very modular and allows for virtually any analysis to be done on the data. However, using Excel to manually complete the analysis is very time consuming and often prone to errors as each formula must manually be modified for each analysis. This means that although the analysis is very modular, changing the parameters of each analysis (such as the time) is nearly impossible. Moreover, the lack of repeatability means that any unexpected results require a recheck of the Excel formulas. The proposed system should address these problems.
